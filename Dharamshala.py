The Dalai Lama's arrival led to the growth of Tibetan culture and Buddhism in the region, with McLeod Ganj becoming a hub for Tibetan refugees and their traditions. Over time, Dharamshala transformed into a center for spirituality, meditation, and Tibetan culture. The townâ€™s historical association with Tibetan politics and its scenic beauty attract visitors from around the world.\n"
