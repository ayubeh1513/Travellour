Originally a quiet village, it gained prominence after the British discovered its pleasant climate in the early 19th century. Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of India, visited Shimla in 1827, marking the beginning of its transformation. By the mid-1800s, it became the British administrative retreat, with colonial architecture like the Viceregal Lodge and Christ Church emerging as landmarks. Shimla also played a significant role in Indian history, hosting the 1945 Simla Conference. Today, it stands as a vibrant reminder of its storied past.\n"
